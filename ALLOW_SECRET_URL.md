# ðŸ”“ Allow Secret URL

GitHub has detected a Twilio Account SID in your git history and is blocking the push. Since we've already removed the hardcoded secrets from the current code, you need to allow this secret using GitHub's provided URL.

## Steps to Allow the Secret:

1. **Click this URL**: https://github.com/visiosoft/fleeto/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/341L57JN1RPZnDIxzR0MhJDICde

2. **Follow GitHub's instructions** to allow the secret

3. **After allowing**, run this command to push:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

## Why This is Safe:

- âœ… We've already removed all hardcoded secrets from the current code
- âœ… The secret is only in the git history (old commits)
- âœ… The current code only uses environment variables
- âœ… We've added proper `.gitignore` rules to prevent future secrets

## Alternative Solution:

If you prefer to completely remove the secret from history, you can:

1. Install Python and git-filter-repo
2. Use `git filter-repo` to rewrite history
3. Force push the cleaned history

But allowing the secret via the URL is the quickest solution since the secret is already removed from the current code.
